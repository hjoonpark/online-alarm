# Online Alarm

can be accessed at https://hjoonpark.github.io/OnlineAlarm/

The issue is that if the web browser is hidden, the timer gets paused by the browser - Chrome, Firefox.

So instead, I ended up making the MacOS application for timer which can be accessed here: https://hjoonpark.github.com/AppWebsites/
