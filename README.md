# Online Alarm

Can be accessed at https://hjoonpark.github.io/OnlineAlarm/.

The issue is that if the web browser is hidden, the timer gets paused by the browser - Chrome, Firefox.

So instead, I ended up making a MacOS application for timer which can be accessed at https://hjoonpark.github.io/AppWebsites/.
