# Online Alarm

Can be accessed at https://hjoonpark.github.io/online-alarm/.

The issue is that if a web browser is hidden for several minutes, the timer gets paused by the browser - Chrome, Firefox.

So instead, I ended up making a macOS application for timer which can be accessed at https://hjoonpark.github.io/AppWebsites/.
